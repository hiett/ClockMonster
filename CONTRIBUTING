Contributions are welcome! However, please note that due to ClockMonster being in such a rapid state of development, 
if I don't feel the contribution pushes the software in the planned direction, it might be rejected.

If you wish to contribute code, the best bet is to first create an issue and describe what you're planning to do. From there if all sounds good,
go ahead and start working on a fork :)

Once done, create a PR and I'll review it & get it merged.

Any questions / want to chat privately, send me a message on Discord @ Scott H#9999.
